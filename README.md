# OCR-Model-for-Local-CPU-and-Edge-Devices
This is an AI ML project being made by combined efforts of 6 team members. We are focusing on building an Optical Character Recognition model that runs efficiently on CPUs and edge devices without requiring high computational resources. Here the edge device we will be using is an Android mobile phone.
Tesseract OCR is used with OpenCV.
